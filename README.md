# ScuffedFlashcards

Backstory: My flashcards became over a 100 and I couldn't print them

This program accepts a pdf file which has the flashcards formatted in a specific way:
**flashcard 1 face   flashcard 1 back
flashcard 2 face   flashcard 2 back**

When you select the file the program will start showing you the faces of random cards with a button "Show answer" below. After the answer is revealed there are 3 buttons: Hard, Medium, Easy which describe the difficulty of the question. Hard questions are most likely to pop up. (I haven't found the time to research the Leitner system yet). Your progress resets daily or when you go through all cards. (Might add some text to congratulate you idk). 
There is still a lot to improve (the UI akhem) but I'll do it after my exams :P
